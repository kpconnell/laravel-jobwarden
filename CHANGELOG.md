# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-jobwarden` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`jobwarden:work` bundles its own Tier-2 local reaper.** The worker now spawns a
  co-resident `jobwarden:reap:local` as a separate child process, so a worker can never
  run without recovery and you never start the reaper yourself. It stays a distinct
  process (outliving a supervisor crash), and a **per-host lease** elects exactly one
  active local reaper even when several workers share a host. Standalone
  `jobwarden:reap:local` remains for advanced splits; disable bundling with
  `jobwarden.supervisor.bundle_reaper=false`. The container/systemd defaults no longer
  run a separate `local-reaper` role.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-07-01

First public beta. The distributed-correctness core and the mechanical breadth are
complete and proven against SQLite, MariaDB/MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

### Added
- **Two-level durable state machine** (Job/Run + immutable Attempts) — the only writer
  of any `state` column, every transition audited in the same transaction.
- **Guarded-UPDATE ownership** (`affected == 1` = ownership) and **per-attempt fencing
  tokens** — no read-then-write anywhere in the concurrency path.
- **Claim drivers**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (PG ≥ 9.5, MySQL ≥ 8.0.1, MariaDB ≥ 10.6)
  with an optimistic-CAS fallback; engine auto-detection.
- **Process supervision**: child-process-per-job execution, process stamps
  (`/proc` start-time + nonce + pidfile), Tier-1 `waitpid` reaping, drain, cancel.
- **Three-tier recovery**: Tier-1 (supervisor `waitpid`), Tier-2 (local reaper,
  `/proc`-verified), Tier-3 (global reaper, leader-leased). Tier-3 keys recovery on the
  **per-process identity** (`worker_id`), so a restart never masks a dead incarnation.
- **Idempotency-gated retry** — idempotent orphans retry with backoff; non-idempotent
  orphans park for an operator.
- **Batches & dependencies**: fan-out, chains, and arbitrary DAGs via `dependsOn`;
  failure policies (`continue` / `fail_fast` / `threshold`); cascade-cancel of
  unreachable dependents; per-member `available_at` (delay / stagger).
- **Scheduler**: cron + one-off, missed-run catch-up, overlap policy, multi-scheduler
  safe (`SKIP LOCKED` + a unique occurrence constraint); a dedicated `scheduled` lane.
- **Durable logs** (DB body sink), export/support bundle, observability read models.
- **Operator HTTP/JSON API** (read + actions + scheduling) and a **Livewire dashboard**.
- **Deployment**: a single "host" image (init baked in) that runs any set of roles via
  `JOBWARDEN_ROLES`; systemd unit templates; a Docker Compose dev stack.
